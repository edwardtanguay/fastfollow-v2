| **Values** | \- **Repeatability over reinvention** – wants systems that scale without constant input |

*   
  **Productivity over growth theater** – prefers real efficiency over vanity ops

* **Clarity over chaos** – seeks visibility, accountability, and streamlined execution

* **Data-backed decision making** – avoids anecdotal action, seeks signal through systems |  
   | **Personality Traits** | Strategic, outcome-oriented, structured, systems-focused, skeptical of trend-chasing, open to new tech *when the ROI is proven*, grounded in leading through clarity and leverage |
